## 🧑‍💻 Hi there! I'm Ray
My name is Rayansh Singh. I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Michigan State Univeristy.

```python
class Rayansh:
    def __init__(self):
        self.age = 20
        self.traits = ["collaborative", "creative", "curious"]
        self.hobbies = ["art", "tennis", "photography", "music", "travelling"]
```

Ever since I was a child, I've loved taking things apart to figure out how they work. That curiosity naturally grew into a passion for technology. I enjoy tinkering with code and building projects that make everyday tasks easier, analyze data in meaningful ways, or automate repetitive processes. Even when things break — as they often do — I have learned that every mistake is a chance to understand something more deeply and to keep growing.
