## üßë‚Äçüíª Hi there! I'm Ray
My name is Rayansh Singh. I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Michigan State Univeristy.

```python
class Rayansh:
    def __init__(self):
        self.age = 20
        self.traits = ["collaborative", "creative", "curious"]
        self.interests = ["backend engineering", "machine learning", "data pipelines"]
        self.hobbies = ["art", "tennis", "photography", "music", "travelling"]
```

Ever since I was a child, I've loved taking things apart to figure out how they work. That curiosity naturally grew into a passion for technology. I enjoy tinkering with code and building projects that make everyday tasks easier, analyze data in meaningful ways, or automate repetitive processes. Even when things break ‚Äî as they often do ‚Äî I have learned that every mistake is a chance to understand something more deeply and to keep growing.
